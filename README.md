# Introduction
The Hangman Game: 

This project is part of an exercise in AI Core designed to help learners practice fundamental Python concepts while also gaining familiarity with Git and GitHub. Hangman is a timeless game where one player selects a word and the other player attempts to guess it within a limited number of tries. In this implementation, the computer selects a word and the user endeavors to guess it.

Overview of Hangman Game
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player attempts to guess it within a limited number of tries.

# What I ve learned/revised:

## Milestone 1 & 2 & 3 :

- Import module random -->Function that is used to generate random items form sequences , with dot operator to acces its functions.In this case we used random.choice function that selects a random item form the sequence of favourite fruits.
- input() function-->that takes input from the screen, returning the input in form of a string
- touch command to create a new file also making sure to have navigated in the correct directory
- Modifying markdown files using Visual code(in this case README.md) which usually includes information about the project description, installation, usage examples .etc Also using "Preview on the side" on the upper right corner of my IDE to have a preview of the markdown file and how it will appear in my remote repo.
- Create a lsit of dots in a markdown file using "-" or "*", creating ordered lists.
- Push changes on Github via interfrated terminal
- Simplify logic by moving code blocks by encapsulating the logical repetition into a single function
- Apply basic Python Syntax including variable assignment, list creating, modules, using loops(while),condition statements(if-else), list manipulation(using random.choice to select a word from the list),string manipulation(checking if a character is present in a string), Conditional logic(using if-else statements),loop control (continues user input until valid input is provided)
## Milestone 3 :

- Function definition and parameter passing:Defining functions allow us to encapsulate blocks of code for reusability and organisation.The parameter passing mechanism allow us to pass data into functions making them more versatile 
- String manipulation:Converting strings into lower case using lower() method
- Gaining familiarity with common programming constructs
- Calling functions in this case ask_for_input() and check_guess -->contains the main logic of the game prompting the user for input and cheking their guesses
